iphone 11 is pretty great!","I know from experience what the phones are like from Amazon. My son has purchased a few phones. And has always has a good experience. So I wasn’t unsure when I purchased this iphone. Works like a charm. I think there is one small scratch, which I do not care about. Especially that it’s covered by my case 24/7. But you wouldn’t notice it unless u really looked. Charges up pretty fast, also depends are how good your charger is. The camera quality is much better then the XR. I was happy about that. I normally only purchase Apple products with apple care. Because I like what they offer with it. But this time I decided to go without. So like if the screen breaks It will be like $250 or more because I don’t have that protection with apple. With apple your price would be more like $99. Keeping in mind if u don’t fix your broken screen it can lead to the phone not working at all. And then you will be stuck buying a whole new one. Bummer. I did recently have some wonky internet issues with my phone and it froze a few times. But nothing to cry about. Simply turning off and back on your phone can fix the problem. And making sure your phone is up to date on software. Will keep it in working order. A++ (I couldn’t take a photo of my phone because well I don’t have another phone lol). But will try to post one in the future if I can get one.",know experi phone like amazon son purchas phone alway good experi ensur purchas phone work like charm think one small scratch care especi cover case 24 7 notic unless u realli look charg pretti fast also depend good charg camera qualiti much better or happi normal purchas appl product appl care like offer time decid go without like screen break like 250 protect appl appl price would like 99 keep mind u fix broken screen lead phone work stuck buy whole new one summer recent onli internet issu phone froze time noth cri simpli turn back phone fix problem make sure phone date softwar keep work order take photo phone well anoth phone ll tri post one futur get one,know experience phone like amazon son purchased phone always good experience ensure purchased phone works like charm think one small scratch care especially covered case 24 7 notice unless u really looked charges pretty fast also depends good charge camera quality much better or happy normally purchase apple products apple care like offer time decided go without like screen breaks like 250 protection apple apple price would like 99 keeping mind u fix broken screen lead phone working stuck buying whole new one summer recently only internet issues phone froze times nothing cry simply turning back phone fix problem making sure phone date software keep working order take photo phone well another phone ll try post one future get one

Apple iPhone 11 Review: A Reliable Backup That Feels Like New","Update:  I'm back with an update on our journey with the iPhone 11, and let me tell you, it's been quite the rollercoaster. Initially, I bought one for my daughter from a different seller, and it was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster. We had issues left and right – Face ID not working, the phone overheating – you name it. So, we returned it, feeling a bit skeptical about the whole refurbished scene.But here's where the plot twists: we decided to give it another go, this time purchasing from the Amazon resellers store, specifically from a shop called Hybrid IT. And oh boy, what a difference! The iPhone we received this time around was nothing short of impeccable. It arrived with all the essentials – a charger, a charging cable, and even a SIM card tool, all neatly packed. The phone itself? It could've fooled me for brand new.This experience really hammered home the lesson that when it comes to refurbished goods, the ""who"" is just as crucial as the ""what."" The quality and condition of the product can vary wildly depending on the seller. Hybrid IT sent out an excellent product that exceeded our expectations in every way.For those of you wary about diving into the world of refurbished electronics, let this be a testament. With the right seller, you can get your hands on a device that feels brand new, without the hefty price tag. We're over the moon with our iPhone 11, and I'll be sure to keep you all posted if anything changes. But for now, it seems like we've struck gold.--------------------I recently found myself in need of a quick replacement after my daughter accidentally broke her phone. The Apple iPhone 11, 64GB in black, seemed like a promising choice, primarily because we needed something that could be set up swiftly and would perform seamlessly as a backup.Out of the box, the iPhone 11 felt like a brand-new device despite being a model released a few years back. The sleek black finish and the familiar design immediately caught my eye, reassuring me that this choice would not disappoint.Setting up the iPhone 11 was mostly straightforward, especially with the unlocked version making it easy to switch from the old device. The transfer of data and settings from the previous iPhone was seamless, thanks to Apple's ecosystem. However, we hit a slight snag with the Face ID setup - it took a bit longer than expected to get it working properly. Despite this hiccup, once configured, Face ID has been working flawlessly.The iPhone 11's performance has been impressive. The touch screen is responsive, making navigation and typing a breeze. Wi-Fi connectivity is fast, ensuring that browsing and app downloads are efficient. Although it's not the latest model, it handles everyday tasks with ease, from streaming video content to gaming, without any noticeable lag.The main issue we encountered was the initial difficulty in setting up Face ID. It required a few attempts to configure, which was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise smooth setup process. After overcoming this challenge, the phone has been working perfectly.Overall, this refurbished Apple iPhone 11 has proven to be a reliable and efficient backup phone. Its ease of setup, fast Wi-Fi, and responsive touch screen make it feel like a new device. The hiccup with Face ID setup was a small obstacle that, once overcome, didn't detract from the overall positive experience. I would recommend the iPhone 11 to anyone in need of a quick replacement or a dependable backup device",updat back updat journey phone 11 let tell quit rollercoast initi bought one daughter differ seller put mildli bit disast issu left right face id work phone overhear name return feel bit skeptic whole refurbish scene plot twist decid give anoth go time purchas amazon revel store specif shop call horrid oh boy differ phone receiv time around noth short implac arriv essenti charg charg cabl even him card tool neatli pack phone could fool brand new experi realli hammer home lesson come refurbish good crucial qualiti condit product vari wildli depend seller horrid sent excel product exceed expect everi way wari dive world refurbish electron let testament right seller get hand devic feel brand new without hetti price tag moon phone 11 sure keep post anyth chang seem like struck gold recent found need quick replac daughter accident broke phone appl phone 11 64gb black seem like promis choic primarili need someth could set swiftli would perform fearlessli back box phone 11 felt like brand new devic despit model releas year back sleek black finish familiar design immedi caught eye reassur choic would disappoint set phone 11 mostli straightforward especi unlock version make easi switch old devic transfer data set previou phone fearless thank appl ecosystem howev hit slight sang face id set took bit longer expect get work properli despit hiccup configur face id work fearlessli phone 11 perform impress touch screen respons make navig tie breez i i conduct fast ensur brow pp download effici although latest model candl everyday task ea stream video content gaze without notic law main issu encount initi difficulti set face id requir attempt configur minor inconveni otherwis smooth set process overcom challeng phone work perfectli overal refurbish appl phone 11 prove reliabl effici back phone ea set fast i i respons touch screen make feel like new devic hiccup face id set small obstacl overcom retract overal posit experi would recommend phone 11 anyon need quick replac depend back devic,update back update journey phone 11 let tell quite rollercoaster initially bought one daughter different seller put mildly bit disaster issues left right face id working phone overhearing name returned feeling bit skeptically whole refurbished scene plot twists decided give another go time purchasing amazon revellers store specifically shop called horrid oh boy difference phone received time around nothing short implacable arrived essentials charge charging cable even him card tool neatly packed phone could fooled brand new experience really hammered home lesson comes refurbished goods crucial quality condition product vary wildly depending seller horrid sent excellent product exceeded expectations every way wary diving world refurbished electronics let testament right seller get hands device feels brand new without hetty price tag moon phone 11 sure keep posted anything changes seems like struck gold recently found need quick replacement daughter accidentally broke phone apple phone 11 64gb black seemed like promising choice primarily needed something could set swiftly would perform fearlessly back box phone 11 felt like brand new device despite model released years back sleek black finish familiar design immediately caught eye reassuring choice would disappoint setting phone 11 mostly straightforward especially unlocked version making easy switch old device transfer data settings previous phone fearless thanks apple ecosystem however hit slight sang face id set took bit longer expected get working properly despite hiccup configured face id working fearlessly phone 11 performance impressive touch screen responsive making navigation tying breeze i i conductivity fast ensuring browsing pp download efficient although latest model candles everyday tasks ease streaming video content gazing without noticeable law main issue encountered initial difficulty setting face id required attempts configure minor inconvenience otherwise smooth set process overcoming challenge phone working perfectly overall refurbished apple phone 11 prove reliable efficient back phone ease set fast i i responsive touch screen make feel like new device hiccup face id set small obstacle overcome retract overall positive experience would recommend phone 11 anyone need quick replacement dependable back device

Priced well, shipped quickly - PRISTINE condition iPhone 11","This refurbed iPhone 11 (seller: Macalegin Electronics) arrived quickly (for a very small shipping charge).  It looked brand new and was in PRISTINE condition -- with good battery health (well within Amazon Renewed standards).  The phone was packed well and came with a brand new wall plug and three foot lightning cable.  Purchase price was at the lower end of the range for this model and condition.This is the third refurbed phone I've bought.  I had sought out the seller of my first two, since they've been excellent, but didn't find what I wanted in their inventory.  So I read reviews and took a chance on this seller, and would happily use them again.  Thanks so much to a fantastic seller!I didn't rate face recognition or fingerprint reader above because I'm not using either one.",return phone 11 seller macalegin electron arriv quickli small ship charg look brand new print condit good batteri health well within amazon renew standard phone pack well came brand new wall plug three foot lightn cabl purchas price lower end rang model condit third return phone bought sought seller first two sinc excel find want inventor read review took chanc seller would happili use thank much fantast seller rate face recognit fingerprint reader use either one,returned phone 11 seller macalegin electronics arrived quickly small shipping charge looked brand new printing condition good battery health well within amazon renewed standards phone packed well came brand new wall plug three foot lightning cable purchase price lower end range model condition third returned phone bought sought seller first two since excellent find wanted inventor read reviews took chance seller would happily use thanks much fantastic seller rate face recognition fingerprint reader using either one

Phone is great! Shipping & setup frustrating","The renewed iPhone 11 itself is in great condition. Battery health is at 91% and came with a screen protector. It’s been 2 weeks since setup completed and so far the phone is functioning as if it is new.[Edited to add:  After 1 month, the screen protector cracked twice. It has protected the main screen, but it is not that durable itself. The screen protector on my old phone went a year without cracking.]My issues are with 1) shipping and 2) setup.1) Shipping:  Amazon said it would arrive on a specific date (3 days from time of order) and would require signature. Well, it was delivered a day early and left at the gate (that is always open), not at my house/door, and no one signed for it. The issue is that the gate is next to a public park, not secure at all and gets a fair amount of foot traffic. We had no idea they delivered it a day early and  anyone could have walked by and taken it. Normally we’d be excited about packages arriving a day early, but this was a high $ item, left in a public area. Thankfully my husband left the house to run an errand and saw it by the gate. Unknown how long it was sitting there.2) Setup took nearly 2 weeks and at least 15 times restating the setup process. It would get a little further in the process each time, then an issue would arise or would lock up and would require to start over again. Our rural town does not have high speed internet so went into town to use Starbucks WiFi & it was not enough to do what was needed. Ended up at a friend’s house but after 2 hrs I had to leave for appointments & errands. First issue, before I could do anything, the new iPhone requires an iOS update. It took 2 hrs to update the iOS on this new phone. Then it got stuck installing it, so had to install/uninstall it 4 separate times. Ended up going on a pre planned trip to see family in a big city and the internet at their house was like night and day. I was able to do the entire setup that weekend, but still had issues & had to call Apple for help. The whole set up process was soooo frustrating, infuriating, and disappointing that it took so long and was not as easy as they make it out to be. & Im good at troubleshooting electronic issues and researching resolutions. One thing I noticed is much of the troubleshooting advice online was outdated, even on the apple help website. Hope others have an easier time with setup.",renew phone 11 great condit batteri health 91 came screen protector 2 week sinc set complet far phone sanction new edit add 1 month screen protector crack twice protect main screen unabl screen protector old phone went year without crack issu 1 ship 2 set 1 ship amazon said would arriv specif date 3 day time order would requir signatur well deliv day earli left gate alway open hous door one sign issu gate next public park secur get fair amount foot traffic idea deliv day earli anyon could walk taken normal excit packag arriv day earli high item left public area thank husband left hous run errand saw gate unknown long sit 2 set took nearli 2 week least 15 time result set process would get littl process time issu would aris would lock would requir start rural town high speed internet went town use starbuck wife enough need end friend hous 2 hi leav appoint errand first issu could anyth new phone requir is updat took 2 hi updat is new phone got stuck instal instal instal 4 separ time end go pre plan trip see famili big citi internet hous like night day abl entir set weekend still issu call appl help whole set process soon frustrat infuri disappoint took long easi make in good troubleshoot electron issu search resolut one thing notic much troubleshoot advic onlin outdat even appl help webster hope other easier time set,renewed phone 11 great condition battery health 91 came screen protector 2 weeks since set completed far phone sanctioning new edited add 1 month screen protector cracked twice protected main screen unable screen protector old phone went year without cracking issues 1 shipping 2 set 1 shipping amazon said would arrive specific date 3 days time order would require signature well delivered day early left gate always open house door one signed issue gate next public park secure gets fair amount foot traffic idea delivered day early anyone could walked taken normally excited packages arriving day early high item left public area thankful husband left house run errand saw gate unknown long sitting 2 set took nearly 2 weeks least 15 times resulting set process would get little process time issue would arise would lock would require start rural town high speed internet went town use starbucks wife enough needed ended friend house 2 his leave appointments errands first issue could anything new phone requires is update took 2 his update is new phone got stuck installing install install 4 separate times ended going pre planned trip see family big city internet house like night day able entire set weekend still issues call apple help whole set process soon frustration infuriating disappointing took long easy make in good troubleshooting electronic issues searching resolutions one thing noticed much troubleshooting advice online outdated even apple help webster hope others easier time set

You get more than you pay for","I purchased this phone as a majorly needed upgrade from my previous OnePlus Nord N200 5G, immediately out of the box, it was a huge upgrade. Considering I paid ~$260, this phone has been a blessing for that price range, especially compared to buying new. It came with a screen protector already applied, which was convenient although I had ordered one in anticipation.My only issues are that the phone came with a small scratch on the silence button which is incredibly visible, and the way it was shipped. It came in a very loose bubble wrap pouch which in the worst case scenario could have caused damage to the product. The box it came in was also very rustic, it didn't have the luxury feel of opening a new phone. Though this is very reasonable, I was expecting more care in it's packaging.Overall, phone runs smoothly, arrived with 50% battery, camera is a high quality, especially portrait and pano modes. Perfectly good luxury phone at a budget price.",purchas phone major need upgrad previou oner word n200 g immedi box huge upgrad consid paid 260 phone bless price rang especi compar buy new came screen protector alreadi appli conveni although order one anticip issu phone came small scratch silenc button incred visibl way ship came loo bubbl wrap pouch worst case scenario could caus damag product box came also rustic luxuri feel open new phone though reason expect care pack overal phone run smoothli arriv 50 batteri camera high qualiti especi portrait piano mode perfectli good luxuri phone budget price,purchased phone majority needed upgrade previous onerous word n200 g immediately box huge upgrade considering paid 260 phone blessing price range especially compared buying new came screen protector already applied convenient although ordered one anticipation issues phone came small scratch silence button incredibly visible way shipped came loose bubble wrap pouch worst case scenario could caused damage product box came also rustic luxury feel opening new phone though reasonable expecting care packing overall phone runs smoothly arrived 50 battery camera high quality especially portrait piano modes perfectly good luxury phone budget price

As Described","The iPhone I purchased from this seller exceeded my expectations. It is a renewed phone, which was described as excellent condition, which I was very skeptical of. The phone is actually in perfect condition. If there are any scratches or blemishes on it? I can’t see them.

Amazing Purchase!",This was an amazing purchase! I opened the box took off the wrap and wow! There is no scratches that mess with the phone or noticeable! It’s like new! I would have thought it was new if it was not labeled at used! The Camera is great! The dual cameras make a great ultra wide view and a main view! Battery capacity is 85% that’s the internal battery. It charges to 100 percent no problem. The internal battery just means that it limits phone use in between charges. So instead of like 17 hrs when it was new now it may  it may go down to 16-15 hrs of use between of charge. It’s a great phone! I’m excited to use it this year!,amaz purchas open box took wrap now scratch mess phone notic like new would thought new label use camera great dual camera make great ultra wide view main view batteri capac 85 intern batteri charg 100 percent problem intern batteri mean limit phone use charg instead like 17 hi new may may go 16 15 hi use charg great phone excit use year,amazing purchase opened box took wrap now scratches mess phone noticeable like new would thought new labelled used camera great dual camera make great ultra wide view main view battery capacity 85 internal battery charges 100 percent problem internal battery means limits phone use charges instead like 17 his new may may go 16 15 his use charge great phone excited use year
